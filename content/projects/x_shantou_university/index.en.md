## 1. Example: Personal Page

For [ShanTou.University](https://ShanTou.University), we refer to it as *[ST.U](https://ShanTou.University)*.

If you want to create your own personal page on ST.U (here we use a personal page as an example), please send an email to *[dev@ShanTou.University](mailto:dev@ShanTou.University)*. When sending the email, be sure to use your alumni email (e.g., <10xxx@alumni.stu.edu.cn>) or your campus email (e.g., <10xxx@stu.edu.cn>).

After receiving a reply, you will find a repository in ST.U's [GitHub repository list](https://github.com/orgs/ShanTouUniversity/repositories) named after your email username, such as *10xxx* (or another reasonable name you applied for).

You need to use any of the following frameworks, or simply *HTML + CSS + JS* to create your own static page (or even a single-page application, SPA). After you upload your work, it will automatically be deployed shortly (assuming you have successfully built it locally). You can then access your page at *10xxx.ShanTou.University*. The first deployment might take some time, but after that, any updates to the GitHub repository will automatically deploy the page.

## 2. Possible Application Scenarios

- Your personal resume;
- A showcase platform for your university innovation project or personal projects;
- Homepage for a club or organization;
- A dedicated page for a course (for example, the Classical Chinese Literature course in the Chinese Department might have poetry assignments, and the created poems could be compiled into a collection);
- Others...
