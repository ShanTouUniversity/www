## Shantou University Undergraduate Student Academic Guide

Universities are academic institutions where aspiring scholars pursue knowledge and explore truth. Graduates of Shantou University should possess independent thinking abilities, outstanding work skills, a deep sense of understanding, and the ability to make judgments about the world and life. Shantou University aims to provide students with high-quality education, cultivating talented individuals who are ambitious, knowledgeable, persistent, and capable, to serve as pillars of the nation.  To achieve this goal, the university strives to offer students high-quality and diverse courses, nurturing their proficiency in English, and respecting students' autonomous choices in academic management.

###  Years of Study
The university adopts a credit system. The minimum duration of study is no less than 3 years and the maximum duration is no more than 6 years. The time spent on maintaining academic status and taking leave of absence are both included in the duration of study (excluding military service). The maximum duration for taking leave of absence for entrepreneurship is no more than 8 years. 

There are two semesters each year, namely the spring semester and the fall semester. Each semester is scheduled for 16+2+2 weeks. Among them, there are 2 weeks for exams and 2 weeks for practical training. The practical training weeks mainly include intensive experiments, internships, etc. The specific arrangements shall be subject to the academic calendar. Students who participate in the spring semester must register at their respective colleges upon the start of the spring semester; students who participate in the fall semester must register at their respective colleges upon the start of the fall semester.

### Courses
Students must complete all courses required by their respective program training plans to graduate. The courses for each program include the following two parts: 

The first part includes common compulsory courses and common core courses required by the university. Common compulsory courses required by the university include: 
- Situation and Policy Education
- Physical Education
- College English
- Introduction to Mobile Programming (or Computer Application Fundamentals)
- Military Training

The university requires students of all programs to complete 27 credits of common core courses. Students must complete these courses and obtain credits for them to graduate.

The second part includes specialized courses and elective courses required for students to learn in each program. Specialized courses for each program include: 
- Program foundation courses
- Program compulsory courses
- Program elective courses
- Graduation thesis or graduation project
- Practical training

In addition to the general education courses required by the university for all students, some programs require their students to take a certain number of credits in general education courses offered by the university or other programs. 

### Course Selection
Students must first select courses to participate in course study, assessments, record grades, and obtain credits. Students should select courses under the guidance of their advisors, following the requirements of their program training plans. Before selecting courses, students should carefully understand the requirements of the university and their program training plans, and arrange their course selection plans for each semester based on their learning interests and abilities. Some courses can only be selected after completing certain prerequisite courses. Students should pay close attention to these courses when selecting courses. It is recommended that students prioritize selecting fundamental courses.

To ensure learning progress and quality, in principle, each student should not select less than 10 credits (excluding practical courses) and no more than 25 credits (including graduation thesis) in the spring and fall semesters.

In general, an upper and lower limit for the number of students selecting each course is specified. If the number of students selecting a course falls below the lower limit, students who have selected the course can choose other courses; if the number of students selecting a course exceeds the upper limit, the university will consider measures to meet students' needs as much as possible. If students' needs cannot be met, the Academic Affairs Office will delete the students who exceed the upper limit of the class size according to the course selection rules.

### Course Study
Students should study courses and participate in assessments according to the course syllabus and assessment requirements. Course grades must be assessed as passing (60 points or above) to obtain course credits. In special circumstances, with the consent of the instructor, some courses can be exempted from attendance or partially exempted from attendance, but students must participate in and pass the course assessment to obtain credits.

### Course Retake
If students fail to pass the assessment for a compulsory course, the assessment grade will be recorded in the student file, and the course must be retaken.

If students fail to pass the assessment for an elective course, the assessment grade will be recorded in the student file. Students can retake the course or choose other courses that meet the requirements of the training plan.

### Program Registration
Some departments have not yet determined students' programs during enrollment. Students in these departments need to register for their programs within the specified time to confirm the program they will continue to study. The principles, time, and requirements for program registration are determined by the respective departments.

### Program Transfer
The university allows some students to transfer from their current program to another program that they prefer.

Students who wish to transfer programs must follow the procedures outlined in the "Shantou University Undergraduate Student Management Regulations" and "Shantou University Full-time Undergraduate Program Transfer Procedures."

After transferring to a new program, students must take courses according to the requirements of the new program. If the courses they have already taken and passed in the previous program are recognized by the department of the new program, they can be exempted.
 
###  Double Major and Minor Programs
The university encourages students to take courses in other programs, provided they successfully complete their major program. All courses completed and passed by students will be recorded on their academic transcripts.

The university offers double major and minor program training plans for most programs. When students meet the graduation requirements for their major program, they will receive a Shantou University double major certificate or minor certificate upon completion of the double major or minor program training plan and obtaining the required total credits.

### Leave of Absence and Dropping Out
Students can apply for leave of absence, but they must submit a formal written application, inform their parents or guardians, and obtain the approval of their department, college, and the university's Academic Affairs Office. Leave of absence is granted in terms of semesters or academic years.

If a student is unable to continue their studies due to health reasons or other reasons, the university may order them to take a leave of absence.

Students who are on leave of absence and wish to return to school must submit a formal written application and obtain the approval of their department, college, and the Academic Affairs Office.

It is the student's right to choose to drop out of school, but the university can also order a student to drop out based on previously established reasons. These reasons may be academic, disciplinary, or health-related. Students who have dropped out cannot re-enroll.

### Graduation and Degree Conferment
Students with official academic status who have completed all courses within the specified period of study, obtained the required credits, and met the university's graduation requirements will be granted graduation and issued a graduation certificate. Students who meet the requirements for degree conferment will be awarded a bachelor's degree certificate.

Students who fail to complete the required credits within six consecutive academic years after enrollment will have their academic status terminated.

Students with official academic status who have completed all courses required by their program training plan but do not meet the graduation requirements will be granted completion and issued a completion certificate.

Students who have been expelled from the university will be issued a study certificate by the university.

### Academic Integrity
Honesty is the university's primary disciplinary requirement for students in academics.

During their studies, students should honestly report their learning progress to their instructors. If they have questions or do not understand the learning content, they should promptly seek guidance from their instructors. If students have independent insights or suggestions during their studies, they should actively discuss them with their instructors or other students. When the university collects student feedback on instructors' teaching, students should truthfully report the instructors' teaching performance.

Plagiarism is a serious violation during the completion of assignments and assessments. If plagiarism is detected in an assignment, the assignment grade for that course will be zero. If plagiarism or theft is detected during assessments (including closed-book and open-book exams, assessments where grades are recorded in papers, and graduation thesis), the grade for that course will be zero, and the student will be subject to disciplinary action.

### Terminology in this "Guide"

#### Credits and Credit System

The credit system is a system that calculates the amount of student learning based on credits and uses this to manage academic records. It specifies the total number of credits students must achieve to complete their studies, as well as the number of credits required for each type of course and for each individual course. The basic guiding principle of the credit system is to allow students to have some autonomy in deciding which courses they take and their academic progress. Students can earn credits for a course after completing it and passing the assessment. The number of credits for each course is determined by the course's position, workload, and difficulty in the training plan. Typically, one credit represents 1 hour of class time and 2 hours of self-study per week for a consecutive semester.

#### Bachelor's Degree

A bachelor's degree is the first level of degree in China's degree system. According to China's current degree system, degrees are divided into three levels: bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctoral degree. Undergraduate students can apply for a bachelor's degree upon graduation and meeting the relevant requirements of the state and the university.

#### Courses and Training Plans

"Courses" can be divided into macro-courses and micro-courses. Macro-courses refer to the system of teaching subjects and educational activities offered by the university. Micro-courses refer to a single course (e.g., English course, ideological and moral cultivation course, analytical chemistry course) or a category of courses (e.g., ideological and political theory courses, general education courses, elective courses). A training plan is similar to the macro-course concept and is an overall arrangement of all learning tasks that students need to complete before graduation. For example, students need to complete all course studies, graduation thesis, and some practical teaching modules before graduation.

#### General Education Courses, Foundation Courses, and Specialized Courses

General education courses are courses offered by the university for all undergraduate students, such as English courses, ideological and political theory courses, and physical education courses. Foundation courses are divided into general foundation courses and specialized foundation courses. The former usually refers to general education courses, while the latter are typically offered by departments and are specifically designed for each department's program. Specialized courses are specialized courses offered for students in each program.

#### Compulsory Courses and Elective Courses

In the training plan for each program, compulsory courses are courses for which students must obtain credits to graduate. Elective courses are courses from which students can choose based on their interests and needs, but they must obtain a certain total number of credits for elective courses. Compulsory courses and elective courses do not differ in importance.

#### Disciplines and Disciplinary Categories

One meaning of "discipline" refers to a systematized body of human knowledge. Human knowledge and experience are primarily passed down through disciplines from generation to generation. Another meaning of "discipline" refers to the teaching subjects of a university. To manage academics, disciplines are typically divided into categories. In China's current discipline classification, a disciplinary category is the most inclusive concept. China's current "Catalog of Undergraduate Programs for Ordinary Higher Education Institutions" (2012 Edition) has 12 disciplinary categories: philosophy, economics, law, education, literature, history, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, management, and arts. Each disciplinary category has a varying number of first-level disciplines. For example, science has first-level disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Each first-level discipline may have a varying number of second-level disciplines. For example, physics has two second-level disciplines: physics and applied physics; mathematics has two second-level disciplines: mathematics and applied mathematics, and information and computer science; economics has four second-level disciplines: economics, international economics and trade, finance, and finance. Discipline divisions are artificial. In reality, human knowledge is a whole, and various disciplines are closely linked. An important goal of Shantou University's teaching reform is to establish connections between different disciplines, enabling students to acquire holistic knowledge and develop comprehensive abilities.

#### Program and Major

Program is the basic unit for cultivating students in Chinese higher education institutions. Programs are represented by a set of courses and aim to develop students to adapt to specific areas of work. For example, the Department of Chinese Language and Literature has a program in Chinese Language and Literature, the Department of Chemistry has a program in Applied Chemistry, and the Department of Public Administration has a program in Public Administration. At Shantou University, most students have already chosen a program before enrollment, but some students have not chosen a program upon enrollment. The latter need to register for a program within the specified time.
