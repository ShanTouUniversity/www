That day, shortly after the Jieyang Alumni Association was established, I had a conversation with a 1998 alumnus. We talked about STU’s past, present, and trends; we also discussed the alumni and how STU utilizes alumni resources.


The idea of creating a connection platform for STU alumni — both graduates and current students — came to me that evening.

Aren’t the existing alumni associations and the various WeChat groups they’ve formed already a connection platform? Yes, but they’re not ideal.

Imagine each alumni association as a class, with active and inactive members. The active ones are confined to their own class, and due to being part of a small active minority, they miss out on exchanges, inspiration, or sparks of ideas; the silent majority may remain quiet due to being introverted, unfamiliar with others, lacking like-minded companions, restricted by the narrow and limiting communication style of WeChat, or simply disliking the insincerity of superficial pleasantries, choosing instead to remain silent.

The active ones are alumni, but also not alumni; the silent ones are not alumni, but also are.

What we need is to bring together those who are interested — whether they were previously active or silent — and give everyone a space to express themselves, a canvas of their own. Every space, every canvas, is a part of `STU`, adding a point to `STU`, transforming it into (almost) everyone's `ST.U`.

I admit that building ST.U on GitHub creates a barrier for the majority who are not tech-savvy, hindering the realization of ST.U's ideal.

But ST.U is still in its early exploratory stage; perhaps with the involvement of a small group of tech-savvy alumni, ST.U's vision can be achieved.
