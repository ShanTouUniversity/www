## 【Please help the Shantou University Business School 2024 Accounting Freshman🙏】

This girl has had a tough life. She was diagnosed with leukemia in 2016, endured painful chemotherapy, and barely made it through. Unfortunately, in 2019, the disease relapsed. She underwent a bone marrow transplant, bravely fought her way through, and finally got into her dream university this year. However, less than a month after starting school, leukemia struck again. Her family, an ordinary working-class one, has spent all their savings over the past 8 years for her treatment and is now heavily in debt... Today, her father is once again preparing to donate his bone marrow to save his daughter.

For this strong father and to save this young life, we earnestly ask for your help. Whether it’s a donation or a share, your support could become the hope she needs! We believe this brave girl can defeat the illness once more! We are deeply grateful for your kindness!

【Share your love, pass on hope for life🌟】

## Patient's Father's Testimony

> Hello everyone, my name is Long Rugen. I am from Shangli County, Jiangxi Province, born in 1976, with a middle school education. I have worked at Shenzhen Kenuoqiao Technology Co., Ltd. since 2010, now in Kuichong.
>
> My wife, Huang Qinghua, born in 1975, with an elementary education, currently works at Tianyong Plastic Factory in Kuichong.
>
> Our only daughter, Long Hang, born in 2003, is a freshman at Shantou University in the class of 2024.
>
> My father is 85, and my mother is 84, both with chronic health conditions and have undergone multiple surgeries. My mother is paralyzed and struggles with mobility. My father, due to a stroke, has slow reactions.
>
> We have a rural self-built house of 80 square meters, with no renovations, just basic furniture. None of us have a driver's license.
>
> Our daughter came to Kuichong for schooling in 2012. On October 23, 2016, less than two months into her first year of junior high, she was diagnosed with leukemia. After chemotherapy at Jiangxi Children's Hospital, her condition eased. In July 2019, after finishing her middle school exams, she went for a follow-up at Longgang Central Hospital, where she relapsed. She was urgently transferred to Shenzhen Children's Hospital and underwent a bone marrow transplant. In 2024, she passed the college entrance exams and was admitted to Shantou University. On September 28, she felt unwell at school and went to Shenzhen People's Hospital, where tests confirmed another relapse.
>
> The various complications, chemotherapy reactions, and rejection responses during treatment have tortured our child. Oral ulcers have covered her mouth, extending to her throat, making it impossible for her to eat anything. A lung infection turned two-thirds of her lungs white, and she spent half a month in the ICU before recovering. Post-transplant, bladder inflammation persisted for half a year with constant blood in her urine. She experienced recurring high fevers with every treatment. The pain from steroids was so unbearable she couldn't stand.
>
> Throughout the treatment, it has mainly been my wife caring for her. Our whole family is mentally and physically exhausted.
>
> The medical expenses are staggering: total costs have exceeded 1.3 million yuan. Due to the high cost of tests, only about 60% of hospitalization fees were reimbursed. The unreimbursed expenses are even more substantial. We have over 600,000 yuan worth of invoices (non-reimbursable) for medication, blood cells, and external tests. Over the past 8 years, living expenses at the hospital, transportation fees, outpatient costs, and other miscellaneous expenses have also exceeded 700,000 yuan. In 2022 alone, she was hospitalized 18 times. Our family spends more time in the hospital than at home.
>
> If Long Hang's illness hadn’t relapsed, we were starting to see a path back to normal life. In two years, we might have recovered financially. But this relapse has plunged us back into a situation where we can’t even afford a proper breakfast. Since her third admission on September 28, 2024, the hospitalization costs have already exceeded 30,000 yuan, and external expenses have reached 65,000 yuan (as of October 6, 2024).
>
> As parents, watching our daughter suffer from this illness time and again breaks our hearts. The past few years have drained us mentally and financially. We are now completely out of options and have no choice but to ask for help from society. We hope kind-hearted people can help save our daughter, Long Hang. We are immensely grateful!
