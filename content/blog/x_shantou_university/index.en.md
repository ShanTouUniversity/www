We refer to [ShanTou.University](https://ShanTou.University) as: *[ST.U](https://ShanTou.University)*.

If you want to create your own personal page on ST.U, please send an email to *[dev@ShanTou.University](mailto:dev@ShanTou.University)*. Make sure to use your alumni email (e.g., 10xxx@alumni.stu.edu.cn) or your university email (e.g., 10xxx@stu.edu.cn) when sending the email.

After receiving a reply, you will find a repository in ST.U's [GitHub repository list](https://github.com/orgs/ShanTouUniversity/repositories) named after your email username, like *10xxx*.

You can use any of the following frameworks, or simply *HTML + CSS + JS* to create your own static page (or even a single-page application, SPA). Once uploaded, your page will be automatically deployed shortly, and you can access your page via *10xxx.ShanTou.University*. The first deployment might take some time, but after that, any updates to your GitHub repository will trigger automatic deployment.
